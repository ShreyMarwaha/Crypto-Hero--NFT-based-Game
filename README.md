## Description
Crypto Bots is an online Non-Fungible Token based card collection and PvE battle game.

## Goal
Every new player starts with minting their first NFT. Each NFT has a randomised color, and randomised stats. There is always only one Hero card of any one color (Hex value).
The player can then use this card as a collectors item or battle with this card to get more and better cards.
Each player has a limit of 30 NFT Hero cards. After reaching this limit, the player canâ€™t battle or mint new ones.
The goal of the game is to create the most aesthetical and powerful army of 30 Hero cards.
